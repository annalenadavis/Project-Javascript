    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players; 
      //this is a reference, not a copy, so if you update team, it will also update players, so arrays work differently than strings, numbers and booleans
      
      console.log(players, team);
    

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
        
//      team[3] = 'Lux'; //since it was a reference, not a copy, it changed both team and players
      
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = 'Lux'; //this only changes team2, not players 
      
      team3 = [].concat(players); //will work same way

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]; //will teke every object out of iteral and spread into new array - can also use with function
      team4[3] = 'new player';
      console.log(team4);
      
      const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
      const person = {
          name: 'Annalena Davis',
          age: 80
      };
      

    // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
//      captain.number = 99; //like an array, with an object, it is being referenced not copied, so changing number changed it for person too
      console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
      console.clear();
      console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
//      const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
